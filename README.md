# INVENTORY MANAGMENT SYSTEM

## About this Program:

This is an example of a system used to track an inventory of a warehouse,store,etc... It has tools to add/delete/ or put/pull an item within the system. It also has a search bar for finding an item based on its name. The banner at the top of the page features as a link back to the dashboard.

## Techonolgies Used:
The technology chosen was based on my past internship experience. This entailed developing a back-end with python (more specifically flask and sqlalchemy) with a mysql database. I did not handle front-end development with my past internship, so for this project I took the time to learn basic html and css to help me build an acceptable user interface.
