            <h2>About this Program:</h2>
            <p>
                This is an example of a system used to track an inventory of a warehouse,store,etc...  It has tools to add/delete/ or put/pull an item within the system.  It also has a search bar for finding an item based on its name.  The banner at the top of the page features as a link back to the dashboard.

            <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
            <p>
                The technologies chosen were based on my past internship experience.  The internship entailed developing a back-end with python (more specifically with flask and sqlalchemy) and a MySQL database.  I did not handle front-end development with my past internship, so for this project I took the time to learn basic html and css to help me build an acceptable user interface.
